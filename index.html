<p>Convert data state changes to actions across your enterprise. Reactive-data enables proactive Data Science. Stargate executes your code in response to real-time events occurring within your enterprise such as uploading of a file, inserting a new record in a database, crawling a website, etc. By managing code execution in an event-driven way, Stargate ensures your resources are efficiently provisioned for the workload of the moment. Stargate makes scalable reactive programming as simple as plug and play.</p>

<a id="how-does-it-work" class="anchor" href="#how-does-it-work" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How does it work?</h3>

<p>Stargate works off of a simple concept. Users write listeners for events in their enterprise. An example of this would be writing a piece of code which listens to a databases write ahead log. Developers can then write simple REST endpoint which listen for these events. These REST services are then packaged up as a docker container and pushed to the Stargate system. When the developer uploads the containers they register what events their container should be started up for. The listeners then will send out "events" from their live stream to the Stargate server instance. These events are currently modeled as JSON from there the Stargate system will then see what containers are running or not running and kick off a new container as it sees fit. It will also take care of scaling down the containers as well based off the number of events it is receiving.</p>

<p>Just needs to emit JSON with the fields event_type which register the high level topic like MySQL and   event_key which talks about the specific table.</p>

<a id="create-a-container" class="anchor" href="#create-a-container" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Create a container</h4>

<p>A docker container that contains a REST end point which can handle JSON being posted to it.</p>

<p>Upload the container to Stargate</p>
